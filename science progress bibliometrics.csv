Lead users are valuable for suppliers because they are active in co-developing products and foreshadowing market needs. Big-science organizations represent a special breed of co-developers, as their demands are not necessarily the avant-garde of a coming market. Yet, they may provide a valuable test bed for suppliers because they are pushing the boundaries of technological capacities and, thus, challenging suppliers' talents. They are also prestigious collaboration partners that help producers to be acknowledged as being at the forefront of technology. They are often deeply engaged in their suppliers' manufacturing and development activities, which is seen as a characteristic of the customer-active paradigm upon which the lead-user notion builds. This paper investigates whether and how interacting with the European Organization for Nuclear Research concerning their development needs may contribute to suppliers' innovation. We ask the question: What characterizes interactions with big-science organizations as a type of lead user, and how do these characteristics impact the potential innovation benefits accruing to the suppliers?",2017-10,2/20/23 14:04,2/20/23 14:04,,345-363,,5,21,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000412467500001,,,,,/Users/de51/Zotero/storage/P83B3XAG/Andersen and Aberg - 2017 - Big-science organizations as lead users A case st.pdf,,CERN; innovation; Big science; INNOVATION; technology transfer; INDUSTRY; interaction; POLICY; CREATION; INFORMATION; lead user; NETWORK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

YZQKB6YG,journalArticle,1997,"Elzinga, A",From Arrhenius to megascience: Interplay between science and public decisionmaking,AMBIO,,0044-7447,,,"The life and work of Svante Arrhenius provides an interesting window on changes in the role of science in society. One hundred years ago, Arrhenius too served as science adviser to government, and he emphasized the importance of internationalism. World War I ruptured the social relations of science, and marked the beginning of a complex intertwining of research with the realm of politics. This paper considers Arrhenius' response to this trend, and asks what he would have thought of today's situation when climatology has become a megascience. Some hints of a possible answer are given against the background of a review of Arrhenius' ideas on method, and his Darwinian perspective on the growth of scientific knowledge. In the course of this, the author makes some observations on how policy determination of scientific agendas introduces an organized social dimension, where the drive for consensus may contradict the traditional ideal of a ''Darwinian struggle of hypotheses'', Arrhenius advocated. At the same time it is noted how the traditional ideal of science as neutral ''truth speaking to power'' is constantly being resuscitated, among others by the leading echelon of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It is suggested that the social dynamics of global-climate-change-science (or ''greenhouse research'') may be understood in terms of a model of mutually reinforcing credibility cycles, linking science and politics.",1997-02,2/20/23 14:04,2/20/23 14:04,,72-80,,1,26,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:A1997WM53200013,,,,,,,CLIMATE PROTECTION POLICY; LIMITS; SCIENTIFIC ADVICE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The International Biological Program was seen by its planners as a means to promote Big Science in ecology. As the term Big Science gained currency in the 1960s, the Manhattan Project and the national space program became paradigmatic examples, but the International Geophysical Year provided scientists with an alternative model: a synoptic collection of observational data on a global scale. This new, potentially complementary model of Big Science encompassed the field practices of ecologists and suggested a model for the natural historical sciences to achieve the stature and reach of the experimental physical sciences. However, the program encountered difficulties when the institutional structures, research methodologies, and data management implied by the Big Science mode of research collided with the epistemic goals, practices, and assumptions of many ecologists. By 1974, when the program ended, many participants viewed it as a failure. However, this failed program transformed into the Long-Term Ecological Research program. Historical analysis suggests that many of the original incentives of the program ( the emphasis on Big Data and the implementation of the organizational structure of Big Science in biological projects) were in fact realized by the program's visionaries and its immediate investigators. While the program failed to follow the exact model of the International Geophysical Year, it ultimately succeeded in providing a renewed legitimacy for synoptic data collection in biology. It also helped to create a new mode of contemporary science of the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER Network), used by ecologists today.",2010,2/20/23 14:04,2/20/23 14:04,,183-224,,2,40,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000277586200002,,,,,,,Big Science; POLICY; UNITED-STATES; data management; data-driven research; EARTH; ECOSYSTEMS; HUMAN GENOME; International Biological Program (IBP); International Geophysical Year (IGY); LESSONS; Roger Revelle; SECURITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the size and complexity of data sets and analyses scales up, a ""Big Science"" approach (Price, 1963) is required that exploits the expertise and resources of interdisciplinary teams spanning academic, government, and industry boundaries. Big science of science studies utilize ""big data"", i.e., large, complex, diverse, longitudinal, and/or distributed datasets that might be owned by different stakeholders. They apply a systems science approach to uncover hidden patterns, bursts of activity, correlations, and laws. They make available open data and open code in support of replication of results, iterative refinement of approaches and tools, and education. This paper introduces a database-tool infrastructure that was designed to support big science of science studies. The open access Scholarly Database (SDB) (http://sdb.cns.iu.edu) provides easy access to 26 million paper, patent, grant, and clinical trial records. The open source Science of Science (Sci2) tool (http://sci2.cns.iu.edu) supports temporal, geospatial, topical, and network studies. The scalability of the infrastructure is examined. Results show that temporal analyses scale linearly with the number of records and file size, while the geospatial algorithm showed quadratic growth.

In the same period Big Science collaborations have proliferated in physics, astronomy, astrophysics, and medicine. Publications that use Big Science data draw on the expertise of those who design and build the equipment and software, as well as the scientific community. Over time a set of 'rules of use' has emerged that protects their intellectual property but that may have the unintended consequence of enhancing co-publication counts. This in turn distorts the use of co-publication data as a proxy for collaboration. The distorting effects are illustrated by means of a case study of the BRICS countries that recently issued a declaration on scientific and technological cooperation with specific fields allocated to each country. It is found that with a single exception the dominant research areas of collaboration are different to individual country specializations. The disjuncture between such 'collaboration' and the intent of the declaration raises questions of import to science policy, for the BRICS in particular and the measurement of scientific collaboration more generally.",2016,2/20/23 14:04,2/20/23 14:04,,653-661,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000436233100084,,,,,,,BRICS COUNTRIES,,"Rafols, I; MolasGallart, J; CastroMartinez, E; Woolley, R",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INDICATORS (STI 2016),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infectious disease genomics are often justified by the potential they have to ameliorate Africa's disease burden. The molecular biology revolution that preceded genomic science widened the gap between the skill sets of many African biologists and their contemporaries elsewhere. Gap closure through genomics and the application of genomic data to health problems requires participation of, and leadership from, African scientists. However, few African scientists participate in genomics, and providing biological samples is their predominant contribution. Health-related applications are emerging from genomic activity for some infectious diseases that are endemic in Africa but not for many others.

Specifically, the setting of our study is the collaboration between the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA) and three SMEs, all involved in the ITER project (i.e., the main Big Science project in the field of nuclear fusion reaction). Thanks to an explorative multiple case study, our work enriches the evidence about the technology transfer practices by considering the entire process of collaboration (i.e., pre-transfer, development, post-transfer) and it suggests that the obstacles and the consequent solutions should be analysed according to the different phases of the process itself.

""Picking winners"" implies special support for selected groups (organizations or individuals). The significance of the research is determined by the need to identify those factors in the policy of ""picking winners"" that can lead to larger effects in the scientific field. We concentrate on three areas, where the policy is being applied: leading research universities, megascience facilities, and young scientists. The aim is to determine how the choice of goals and selection criteria for ""picking winners"" influence the results of this policy in terms of the development of science at universities, enhancement of scientific equipment, and improvement in scientific workforce composition. The hypothesis of the study is that the criteria used and the way policy goals are formulated may become an obstacle to achieving sound results in these areas. The research exploits empirical data and information related to the processes of policy implementation, as well as analyzes official regulatory documents that underline the decision-making. The study showed that the focus on ""picking winners"" does not ensure their sustainable development and does not provide larger effects for scientific potential.

Summary Background Data: The NIH budget is expected to be relatively stable in the foreseeable future, with a modest 0.7% increase from 2005 to 2006. Funding for basic and clinical science research in surgery is also not expected to increase. Methods: NIH funding award data for US surgery departments from 2002 to 2004 was collected using publicly available data abstracted from the NIH Information for Management; Planning, Analysis, and Coordination (IMPAC) II database. Additional information was collected from the Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects (CRISP) database regarding research area (basic vs. clinical, animal vs. human, classification of clinical and basic sciences). The primary outcome measures were total NIH award amount, number of awards, and type of grant. Statistical analysis was based on binomial proportional tests and multiple linear regression models. Results: The smallest total NIH funding award in 2004 to an individual surgery department was a single $26,970 grant, whereas the largest was more than $35 million comprising 68 grants. From 2002 to 2004, one department experienced a 336% increase (greatest increase) in funding, whereas another experienced a 73% decrease (greatest decrease). No statistically significant differences were found between departments with decreasing or increasing funding and the subspecialty of basic science or clinical research funded Departments (n = 5) experiencing the most drastic decrease (total dollars) in funding had a significantly higher proportion of type K (P = 0.03) grants compared with departments (n = 5) with the largest increases in total funding; the latter group had a significantly increased proportion of type U grants (P = 0.01). A linear association between amount of decrease/increase was found with the average amount of funding per grant and per investigator (P < 0.01), suggesting that departments that increased their total funding relied on investigators with large amounts of funding per grant. Conclusions: Although incentives to junior investigators and clinicians with secondary participation in research are important, our findings suggest that the best strategy for increasing NIH funding for surgery departments is to invest in individuals with focused research commitments and established track records of garnering large and multiple research grants.",2007-12,2/20/23 14:04,2/20/23 14:04,,1110-1115,,6,246,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000251638000030,,,,,,,NIH; ERA; AWARDS; CLINICAL-RESEARCH; ENVIRONMENT; RECENT TRENDS; SCIENTIST; US BUDGET,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, the propensity for international collaboration is lower for resident scientists than for those affiliated with domestic universities or government laboratories.

This essay examines the lives and careers of two American physicists, Merle A. Tuve and Robert R. Wilson, in order to explore the history of the pure science ideal and the centrality of moral virtue to scientific identity in the mid-twentieth century. For Tuve and Wilson, belief in the humanistic qualities of science and the virtues-both epistemic and moral-of austerity and contemplative isolation, as well as an instinctive disdain for post-World War II Big Science despite the heavy involvement of both men in large-scale research projects, defined their faith in science as a morally virtuous activity. In a cold war era of military patronage, in which political and institutional trends seemed headed increasingly in the direction of instrumentalist expectation rather than transcendent humanism, Tuve's and Wilson's insistence on the moral virtues of scientific inquiry marked a larger struggle at work over the cultural meaning and status of physics, the nature and values of American culture more generally, and even over modernity itself.",2017,2/20/23 14:04,2/20/23 14:04,,27-47,,,321,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000432825600003,,,DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-48893-6_3,,,,Big science; High energy physics; UNITED-STATES; HISTORY; ACCELERATORS; Cold War science; EMOTION; Epistemic virtues; History of physics; Merle A.

PPJHLB4B,book,2015,"Channell, DF",Technological Thinking in Science,,978-94-017-9762-7,,,,"Technological thinking has played a role in science throughout history. During the ancient period mechanical devices served as ways to investigate mathematical and scientific ideas. In the medieval period the mechanical clock provided scientists with a new way to conceive of time. By the period of the Scientific Revolution the clock came to play an important role in the development of the mechanical philosophy and new devices, like the air pump served as the basis for the experimental philosophy. During that period technology also came to provide a new ideology for science. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the emergence of the engineering sciences played an important role in scientific thinking with thermodynamics serving as a new way to understand all scientific processes. Engineering concepts such as strain, elasticity, and vortex motion provided a way to think about electromagnetism and theories of the aether. The scientification of technology during the second half of the nineteenth century led to science-based industries which in turn led to industry-based science emerging from the industrial research laboratories. By the twentieth century the military-industrial-academic complex and the emergence of big science combined to create technoscience in which the distinctions between science and technology became blurred. The role of technological thinking in science culminated in the computer replacing the heat engine, and the clock before that, as a new model to understand scientific phenomena.",2015,2/20/23 14:05,2/20/23 14:05,,,27,,18,,,,ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN SCIENCE: PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVES,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000374947300004,,,Pages: 53 DOI: 10.1007/978-94-017-9762-7_3,,,,INDUSTRY; BIG SCIENCE,,"Hansson, SO",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Especially, the benefits of fundamental science projects are less obvious and indirect than applied science (e.g. pharmaceutical or IT). Pure scientific quality does not tell anything about the societal and economical value of the project. Public resources used for funding the growing scientific research face scarcity, and choosing where to distribute the limited resources is difficult without tools to assess the impacts. Politicians and other decision makers are struggling to evaluate the benefits of supporting science projects. Therefore, it is essential to find methods to fairly measure the impacts of science projects into the surrounding society. One way of assessing societal impact is Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA).

De Solla Price delivered a series of lectures at Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1962, which was dedicated to discussing science and its interaction with society. The collection of these lectures was published in 1963 as a book entitled Little Science, Big Science. Here, Price empirically established that the initial exponential growth pattern of literature reaches a ceiling after a certain time span, which results a logistic growth pattern. This paper analyses Price's empirical theory on the basis of 198 articles that presented growth of literature of variant subjects published since 1913 to 2018. In all, 214 growth models were reported by the 198 articles that analysed growth of literature of more than 50 subjects. It is found that growth patterns reported by nearly 50% articles followed Price's empirical theory, i.e., exponential and logistic growth pattern while remaining 50% articles followed other growth patterns, viz., power model, linear model, etc. All growth models reported by the 198 articles were broadly categorised into five groups on the basis of statistical characteristics, viz., (exponential + logistic), growing without definite pattern (GWDP), linear, non-linear and decaying models. The null hypothesis formulated states that 214 growth models observed by different subjects described in 198 articles will follow either of the five patterns that will be guided by Bradford's Law of Bibliographic Scattering. The null hypothesis is accepted by Chi-square test. It is inferred that the distribution of different models of growth of literature is guided by Bradford's Law where the core or nucleus zone is occupied by the logistic and exponential model, i.e. Price's empirical model prevails in Bradford's nuclear (core) zone.",2020-03,2/20/23 14:05,2/20/23 14:05,,17-23,,1,67,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000545299400002,,,,,,,MODEL; BIG-SCIENCE; ARTICLE; BOOK; De Solla Price; Exponential growth; Growth of literature; Literature growth; Logistic growth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we problematise this assumption by focusing on the effect of a big science project on local development in the context of a marginalised region of South Africa, the semi-arid Karoo. We undertake a normative analysis of the development roles and responsibilities of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescope. We examine how development mandates are conceived of by the science institution and by local communities, and why these conceptions are aligned or diverging. We find that the SKA local development mandate is disputed. On the one hand, it is distinct from the universalist techno-economic argument that underpins the SKA mandate at the global level and the innovation and growth argument that underpins its mandate at the national level. At the local level, the perception of the SKA's development mandate is shaped by both significant benefits and significant losses that are distinct from the telescope's impact on the planet and the country. The local development mandate is tacit, must engage with local social and economic complexities and operate under significant budget constraints. At the same time, local perceptions of the development mandate can best be understood through the prism of local interests, including economic, social and cultural interests. Consequently, there are diverse perceptions of what the SKA's local development mandate is and should be. Misalignment of perceptions has led to strained relations between the SKA and local stakeholders, suggesting that the SKA and other big science projects with a footprint in the developing world may benefit from social science research that unpacks local social complexity in relation to development and engagement strategies.",7/4/19,2/20/23 14:05,2/20/23 14:05,,711-728,,4,45,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000480784600001,,,,,/Users/de51/Zotero/storage/WUEY6GJE/Gastrow and Oppelt - 2019 - The Square Kilometre Array and Local Development M.pdf,,astronomy; HISTORY; EMPLOYMENT; local development; public engagement with science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Implications are explained in different ways. In this paper it is argued that the current crisis in science is not only a mere question of budget constraints, or the overwhelming poverty of the R&D sector. The massive size of military and space research and the persistent Soviet legacy (e.g. the maintenance of the status quo of the Academy of Sciences, the cultural resistance to change institutions and structures, the continued reliance on big science approaches to little science problems, etc.) explain why Russian and Ukrainian scientists have great difficulties in bringing about reform. Western governments and organisations should encourage peer review, decentralisation of science policy, a shift to smaller programmes and greater support in the civilian sector in part through the funds they provide to Russian and Ukrainian scientists.",1998,2/20/23 14:05,2/20/23 14:05,,141-149,,,23,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000074757600013,,,,,,,,,"Meske, W; MosoniFried, J; Etzkowitz, H; Nesvetailov, G",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRANSFORMING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS - THE ENDLESS TRANSITION?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared to the remarkable progress during the first 30 years after World War 11, the last 30 years have been characterized by a self-congratulatory illusion of progress, the fruits of which have failed to reach Our patients. The problem may lie with the fact that the (often lone) clinical innovator of the past who made all the difference to the spectacular progress of medicine during the golden age has been marginalized to the extent that he is now an endangered species. The two definable forces that have led to his alienation are the hegemony of molecular science and the primacy accorded to the randomized clinical trial in biomedical research.

Although tremendous strides have been made in S&T in post-independence India, development is mainly focused on creating big S&T institutions and upgrading S&T infrastructure in major cities ('big science', macro-S&T). Rural India, which still accounts for 70% of the nation's population, has been grossly ignored. There is an urgent need to implement the notion of 'small science' (micro-S&T) tailored for the rural sector to make villagers self-reliant. A beginning could be made by aggressively promoting outreach programmes in modern science education and research for young village students. Also, steps should be taken to establish a number of modest Rural Institute of Science Education and Research (sort of mini-IISER) spread all over the country with the ultimate goal of 'science for all'. In the present setting, competition between rural and urban youth is uneven and unjust. It is time we provide villagers a level playing field and take them on board as equal partners.

Today's theoretical lenses allow for an understanding of causal relations in climate debates that exceed narrowly defined impact studies. I focus on four areas that exemplify shifts in engagement with adaptation, stretch themes of inquiry, and delineate zones for analysis and action: (1) reconnecting scale: multiscalar interactions, scalar dimensions of practice, and traversing scales from embodied experiences to the global intimate; (2) destabilizing gender: from gendered vulnerability and adaptive capacity to fragmented identities and intersectionality; (3) repositioning persistent inequalities: from rights to responsibilities, mutual fragility, and human security; and (4) reframing certainty: from climate proofing to limits, traps, and transformative change.

While this representation is useful to understand many developments of the space age, it has tended to downplay the role of natural history practices of data collection and interpretation in the development of space technology. The notion of sociotechnical imaginary helps to reveal a more complex and complete understanding of the history of space technology. Between 1967 and 1973, the vision of the French remote-sensing satellite as both enabled by and an extension of aircraft photo-interpretation helped to shape scientific and technological expectations of remote-sensing technology. In turn, the practices, values, and visions of aircraft photo-interpreters informed the development of satellite remote-sensing work. In particular, the fieldwork-driven research mode, focusing on data collection and field observations, was an important part of satellite technology development -a tie which remains strong today. Approaching remote-sensing satellite technology through historical research not only suggests a particular way of imagining space technology within the tradition of field science practices, discourses, and history, but also allows us to reflect on the power and limitations of prevalent imaginaries to fully understand the space age and its place in history.",4/3/22,2/20/23 14:05,2/20/23 14:05,,163-186,,2,31,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000719180100001,,,,,/Users/de51/Zotero/storage/EG4YAPNM/Cirac-Claveras - 2022 - Re-imagining the space age Early satellite develo.pdf,,France; aerial photography; field sciences; GLOBAL VISIONS; history of technology; IMAGINARIES; remote-sensing satellites; Sociotechnical imaginaries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many would instinctively support the assertion that scientific progress is a cornerstone of national well-being, but the connection between strong federal support of research and vigorous economic growth or societal vitality is not straightforward.  Two variables-science and technology, not science alone, are basic to the larger issues of the economy and social welfare.  Federal policy must facilitate development in coordination with support for basic science.  Scientists, in turn, must help foster a perspective that encompasses research and development as a whole and that seeks to identify explicitly the connections between the nature of the R&D effort and economic vitality and quality of life.  Furthermore, society needs a free flow of information between all members of the science and technology community and an end to the artificial and harmful barriers between them.

That role is well known (most know of the story of Fleming's accidental discovery of penicillin) but much of the literature focuses on the STEM disciplines, on 'big' science, and concentrates on the work of established scientists. There is virtually no discussion of the role of serendipity in the doctoral research arena, an arena which contributes significantly to contemporary scientific endeavour and the associated publications. This article reports the initial results from a survey of doctoral students and PhD graduates which explores how serendipity contributes to the PhD process and also the forms serendipity takes in this arena. Following the conceptual differentiation of serendipity from accident or chance, the article explores the intersection of serendipity with doctoral research. Most respondents reported serendipitous occurrences happening in the doctoral experience, with the most important involving them stumbling across unexpected and unsearched-for literature, meeting others who proved to be significant for both their research and also their future development and careers, and finding project-related artefacts which expanded their projects and thinking. There were also reports of second-hand serendipity a hitherto uncommented on phenomenon.

With the dimensions of anticipation, reflexivity, inclusiveness and responsiveness advocated here, social accountability of research has just been expanded again: factually (applying to the scientific practice of all domains), temporally (becoming more and more permanent) and socially (involving more and more actors). The following study will first reconstruct the current prominence of RRI as the dynamics of a changing relationship between science and society, then explore into the claim and reality of RRI as documented in publicly available material. The observation: While RRI at the level of its program aims at legitimacy through democratization of knowledge production, the organization of RRI demonstrates highly orchestrated bureaucratic arrangements and procedures.

I discuss the how mega-science projects sit between being merely complicated, and chaotic, and explain the importance of understanding multiple dimensions of project complexity. Project manager/leader traits are briefly discussed, including capability to govern and control such enterprises. Project structures are examined, including the challenge of collaborations. I show that early attention to building project resilience, curbing optimism, and risk alertness can help prepare large high-tech projects against threats, and why project managers need to understand aspects of 'the silent power of time'. Mission assurance is advanced as a critical success function, alongside the deployment of task forces and new combinations of contingency plans. I argue for increased project control through industrial-style project reviews, and show how post-project reviews are an under-used, yet invaluable avenue of personal and organisational improvement.

The Ulrich's Periodical Directory, Library of Congress Subject Heading, retrieved from the WorldCat and LISA database were used to identify the main class, subclass and subject of cited journals and books. The results of this study revealed that the production rate of JASIST literature doubles and the average number of references cited per paper is also increased 2 to 3 times in a period of about 25 years. Beginning in 1995, there has been a significant increase in the number of electronic resources and constitutes 5% of all document types in 2004. JASIST itself is the most highly cited, and is followed by four library and information science (LIS) journals, namely Information Processing and Management, Journal of Documentation, Annual Review of Information Science and Technology and Journal of Information Science.

Closing one big science project may afford 1000 small science projects quantitatively. As such, decision-making on a big science project is not only a scientific issue, but also a socio-economic one. Based on the cost-benefit analysis of LHC (big science) and CNAO (small science), we found that small science projects have a higher benefit/cost ratio. At least three policy effects need to be considered: (1) Decision on investing in a big science project should consider both scientific and socio-economic merits. (2) Small science projects could be more effective than bigger ones in exploring the scientific frontier. (3) Replacing one big science project with many small science ones might benefit the scientific enterprise.",8/25/21,2/23/23 13:55,2/23/23 13:55,,479-484,,4,121,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000687735000018,,,,,; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/CB3G3EGA/Wei et al. - 2021 - One big science project or 1000 smaller ones.pdf,https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/121/04/0479.pdf,Big and small science; cost-benefit analysis; COST-BENEFIT-ANALYSIS; Nobel Prize; SOCIETAL IMPACT; socio-economic merits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NS emerges as a highly internationalised fast-growing field whose research is firmly rooted in Physics, Chemistry and Engineering, but with applications in a wide range of fields. International collaboration links -present in around 70% of the documents- and national links have largely contributed to mould the existing structure of research in the area, which evolves around major neutron scattering facilities abroad.

Design/methodology/approach The study conducts an exploratory research and adopts the grounded theory methodology in the context of BSP. Data draw mainly upon nine semi-structured interviews. Findings The knowledge spillovers in BSP are driven by institutions, which work through mechanisms of legitimacy perception. Formal and informal institutions influence organizational and individual behavior through legitimacy pressure and support. Formal institutions impose legitimacy pressure on organizations and individuals, forcing them to cooperate closely to solve problems; informal institutions enable them to adopt innovative strategies and positive attitudes through legitimacy support; all these promote knowledge spillovers in research and development (R&D) activities, engineering practice and regional interaction. Knowledge spillovers enable stakeholders to realize their R&D advancement, manufacturing promotion and management sophistication. Further, regional knowledge diffusion and culture transmission promote regional innovation and social capital accumulation. Research limitations/implications The study develops a theoretical model that shows how knowledge spillover mechanisms happen in BSP from an institutional perspective (the trigger, the channels/process and the impacts). More specifically, this explanation is provided by explaining how formal and informal institutions influence organizational and individual behavior through legitimacy perceptions. Practical implications First, policymakers should recognize and value the guiding, supporting and coordinating role of formal institutions and enrich capital forms to release the legitimacy pressure of stakeholders. Second, management of BSP needs to be capable of coordinating stakeholder relationships and interactions, while management should focus their attention on fostering good organizational routines and shared group value. Third, the local culture and customs should be taken into consideration since it can be an enabling or constraining of BSP. Finally, industries can take advantage of the opportunity to coordinate their R&D efforts to gain competitiveness. Originality/value First, the authors introduce the institutional perspective to analyze the construction process of BSP, which helps to better understand the interactions of stakeholders under the influence of institutions, the dynamic process and impacts of knowledge spillovers. Second, the authors are committed to contributing to the development of knowledge spillover theories by adopting an institutional perspective. The authors furthermore explore and propose the presence of a dynamic mechanism between institutional dualism and knowledge spillovers. In consequence, the authors introduce the concept of legitimacy perceptions, which is a bridge to understanding the interaction between them. Third, by explicitly discussing the actual meaning of our framework, the authors explore the unique potential of institutional arrangement in promoting the knowledge management of complex cross-border cooperation, while seeking to promote its management and administrative practices.",1/27/21,2/23/23 13:55,2/23/23 13:55,,48-84,,1,25,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000558313600001,,,,,; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/YUHXKHUK/Zhang et al. - 2021 - Knowledge spillover driven by institutions eviden.pdf,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JKM-11-2019-0675/full/pdf?title=knowledge-spillover-driven-by-institutions-evidence-from-the-big-science-project-in-china,Institutions; FRAMEWORK; INNOVATION; COLLABORATION; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; Legitimacy; TECHNOLOGY; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; Big science project; Grounded theory; INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS; Knowledge spillover; LEGITIMACY; LOCALIZATION; PERSPECTIVES; University-industry-government (UIG),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Literature assessing the impact of big science focuses on its contributions towards new fundamental insights about the universe; the development of skills, capabilities, networks, and innovation; and the development of globally transformative technology platforms that in turn make significant impacts on global human development. However, research into the local development impact of big science infrastructure is scarce. In this paper we reflect on the development impact of a big science project at the local level, drawing on the case study of the Square Kilometre Array telescope in South Africa's Karoo region. We find that the universalist logic that appears to apply at the global and national levels does not necessarily apply at the local level, where big science has resulted in human development benefits, but also substantial economic and social costs. On this basis we recommend that big science infrastructures, particularly in marginalised areas of developing countries, require a localised development proposition that takes into account local social complexities on the basis of extensive local engagement. Significance: A synthetic review is presented of the different causal pathways through which big science may impact on human development. Analytical distinctions are developed between the human development impacts of big science at the global, national, and local scales.

The present paper proposes a framework for depicting and discussing the various contributions of big science centres in a systematic manner. The main objective of the paper is to provide policy-makers, industrialists, and academics with a framework to justify, motivate and establish systematic technological interaction between big science centres and industry. The framework comprises six basic dimensions. These dimensions are viewed both from the industrial and from the scientific perspective, and partly from the public perspective.

This paper investigates the time span needed for technology suppliers of CERN to absorb the knowledge acquired during the procurement relation and develop it into a patent. We estimate count data models relying on a sample of CERN suppliers for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator. Firms in our sample received their first LHC-related order over a long-time span (1995-2008). This fact is exploited to estimate the time lag that separates the beginning of the procurement relationship and the filing date of patents. Becoming a supplier of CERN is associated with a statistically significant increase in the number of patent applications by firms.

The new urban area, together with the research facilities dedicated to science and the development of knowledge, expands the city of Lund onto high-quality agricultural land. In doing so, the municipal planning is attempting to align contemporary ideas of sustainable urban development with large-scale scientific infrastructure. This actualizes an ethical dilemma as the urban expansion onto productive agricultural land overrides previous decisions taken by the municipality regarding land use. It can also be understood as going against national land use policy which states that development on productive agricultural land should be avoided. As the planning stands today, the research facilities heavily push local urban development into the area while the intended research outcomes primarily relate to a global research community tied to international scientific demands for materials science. Although the Brunnshog area is realized through a neutralizing planning strategy, thought to balance and compensate for the development on farmland, the effects of the counterbalancing acts are primarily played out at a local urban level in terms of diverse, exciting, and locally sustainable neighbourhoods. The land use protection policies meant to secure national food production rather operates on a national scale. The argument made in this text is that sustainable development, and the intended balancing acts it involves, ought to be carefully considered in terms of scalar effects.

Our approach captures not only the growth of China, India, and the Republic of Korea but also the decline of Canada, Japan, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Time points of their rise and fall are related to tokamak operation, highlighting the importance of large facilities in big science.

Our bibliometric estimates highlight two main results. First, latecomers' national systems of public research institutes play a major role, and initially produced a large proportion of the research output, but this influence declined as IC increased. Second, IC greatly increased both the quantity and quality (number of citations) of research output in all latecomers. In most countries, the IC strategy has shown a strong correlation with the research output. The findings highlight the importance of a national research-support system and development of IC as strategies for new states that are entering the HEP field, and provide comparison of the two strategies.

Although in accordance to CERN's procurement rules our results highlight the role of both technological factors and political constraints, we also show the existence of a premium toward Swiss and French firms. We document that the constraints related with the achievement of a juste retour affect-directly or indirectly-the procurement policy of many European BSCs and international bodies whose budget is financed by the public funds of their MS.

Large grants would be more effective only if scientific impact increases as an accelerating function of grant size. Here, we examine the scientific impact of individual university-based researchers in three disciplines funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). We considered four indices of scientific impact: numbers of articles published, numbers of citations to those articles, the most cited article, and the number of highly cited articles, each measured over a four-year period. We related these to the amount of NSERC funding received. Impact is positively, but only weakly, related to funding. Researchers who received additional funds from a second federal granting council, the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, were not more productive than those who received only NSERC funding. Impact was generally a decelerating function of funding. Impact per dollar was therefore lower for large grant-holders. This is inconsistent with the hypothesis that larger grants lead to larger discoveries. Further, the impact of researchers who received increases in funding did not predictably increase. We conclude that scientific impact (as reflected by publications) is only weakly limited by funding. We suggest that funding strategies that target diversity, rather than ""excellence"", are likely to prove to be more productive.",6/19/13,2/23/23 13:55,2/23/23 13:55,,,,6,8,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000322361200013,,,,,; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/MCT3YQ5J/Fortin and Currie - 2013 - Big Science vs. Little Science How Scientific Imp.pdf,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0065263&type=printable,COST; BASE-LINE GRANT; CANADA; EVERY QUALIFIED RESEARCHER; SYSTEM EXCEEDS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, the field can be traced to early quantitative studies in the early 20th century. In the 1930s, it evolved to the ""science of science."" The publication of J.D. Bernal's Social Function of Science in 1939 was a key transition point but the field lay dormant until after World War II, when D.J.D. Price's books Science Since Babylon and Little Science, Big Science were published in 1961 and 1963. His role as the ""Father of Scientometrics"" is clearly evident by using the HistCite software to visualize his impact as well as the subsequent impact of the journal Scientometrics on the growth of the field. Scientometrics owes its name to V.V. Nalimov, the author of Naukometriya, and to Tibor Braun who adapted the neologism for the journal. The primordial paper on citation indexing by Garfield which appeared in Science 1955 became a bridge between Bernal and Price. The timeline for the evolution of Scientometrics is demonstrated by a HistCite tabulation of the ranked citation index of the 100,000 references cited in the 3000 papers citing Price.

We discuss the characteristics of companies that benefit from the findings of public research institutions. In questioning 2300 companies, we found that less than one-tenth of product- or process-innovating firms introduced innovations between 1993 and 1995 that would not have been developed without public research. These new products amount to approximately 5% of all new product sales. Universities are cited by firms with publicly supported innovations as the most important source, although publicly financed laboratories get almost as many citations. Big science laboratories are almost invisible, suggesting that their technology transfer to industrial firms still lacks effectiveness. Firms also tend to cite research institutions that are located close to the firm. But contrary to the widely held opinion that proximity to public research institutions does promote collaboration between firms and public research and increase the amount of received knowledge spillovers, we found no higher probability of publicly supported innovations for firms in Germany that an located near universities or polytechnics. However, the firm's own R&D activities instead support the ability to absorb the fndings of public research and turn them into innovations. Additionally, firms with high R&D intensities cite remote public research institutes more frequently than less R&D-intensive firms, suggesting that in Germany, high-technology does not depend on co-location of public and private research.

To tackle this requires synthesis: the integration of disparate information to generate novel insights from heterogeneous, complex situations where there are diverse perspectives. Since 1995, a structured approach to inter-, multi-and trans-disciplinary(1) collaboration around big science questions has been supported through synthesis centres around the world. These centres are finding an expanding role due to ever-accumulating data and the need for more and better opportunities to develop transdisciplinary and holistic approaches to solve real-world problems. The Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (ACEAS http://www.aceas.org.auN) has been the pioneering ecosystem science synthesis centre in the Southern Hemisphere. Such centres provide analysis and synthesis opportunities for time-pressed scientists, policy-makers and managers. They provide the scientific and organisational environs for virtual and face-to-face engagement, impetus for integration, data and methodological support, and innovative ways to deliver synthesis products. We detail the contribution, role and value of synthesis using ACEAS to exemplify the capacity for synthesis centres to facilitate trans-organisational, transdisciplinary synthesis. We compare ACEAS to other international synthesis centres, and describe how it facilitated project teams and its objective of linking natural resource science to policy to management. Scientists and managers were brought together to actively collaborate in multi-institutional, cross-sectoral and transdisciplinary research on contemporary ecological problems. The teams analysed, integrated and synthesised existing data to co-develop solution-oriented publications and management recommendations that might otherwise not have been produced. We identify key outcomes of some ACEAS working groups which used synthesis to tackle important ecosystem challenges. We also examine the barriers and enablers to synthesis, so that risks can be minimised and successful outcomes maximised. We argue that synthesis centres have a crucial role in developing, communicating and using synthetic transdisciplinary research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies have been devoted to the systematic evaluation of the scientific effects of China's RIs. This paper attempts to fill this gap by designing a comprehensive analytical framework composed of the input-side, output-side, process-side and environment side effects of RIs on scientific activities. The analysis is implemented based on a novel sample composed of nine of China's typical RIs. More specifically, this paper classified these nine Chinese RIs into the following three types according to their functions: dedicated research infrastructure, public experimental platform and public infrastructure. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the features of the scientific effects of these RIs in terms of the following four typical scientific effects: science and technology advancement effect, capability cultivation effect, networking effect and clustering effect In addition to the finding that RIs have promoted scientific advancements in many disciplines in China, the study found that RIs are important to the acquisition of new knowledge, and also contribute to the propagation of competitive scientific organizations and scientific talent. Networking and clustering impacts are also important scientific effects of RIs, as they increase the effectiveness of scientific activities in China. This paper not only contributes to developing an analytical framework for evaluating the functions and effects of large Rls but also presents evidence regarding the development of large Rls in emerging countries.

This is hardly surprising given that their main mission is to harness science and technology to foster innovation that can improve the quality of life and boost economic competitiveness. In the current economic context, it is key to demonstrate the positive impact of their activities on the economy and society, i.e. spin-offs, considering that they receive public subsidies. Accordingly, the European Association of Research and Technology Organisations (EARTO) published a report in March 2018 that details the economic footprint of 9 of its members, which includes the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). This French organisation, whose budget represents 60% of the total budget from all 9 RTOs, was the subject of a separate calculation in the framework of the research carried out for the paper: data was provided by the CEA and simulation was performed on the basis of the model provided by IDEA Consult. This article deals with the provision of empirical results about the CEA and makes a comparison with the results obtained for the 9 RTOs using the same methodology. This case study highlights information that can be used to provide a more accurate assessment of the CEA's economic impact based on its specificities compared with its European counterparts. In addition to estimating the economic spin-offs of technology transfers, it is equally important to take into account value creation associated with the procurement of high technology-the impact of ""big science""-which is substantial in the CEA's defence sector and undervalued in the economic model used by IDEA Consult. Thanks to a literature review summarising the advantages and limitations of the different impact assessment approaches and thanks to interviews at CEA management level-that helped us to better understand the impact-generating mechanisms-the paper opens new avenues of research to improve the methodology for measuring the impact of research organisations that are very diverse in their duties. The new methodology proposed takes into account the spillovers of their activities, as well as offering useful approaches for governments and the European Commission. More specifically, it proposes to apply the same methodology-in the opposite direction-to measure the spin-offs of the contract research activities (with a multiplier as in the methodology used by IDEA Consult) and to estimate the science market characterised by very specific calls for tender that generate innovation. Using the same model, we therefore propose to couple an estimate of the footprint of jobs and standard purchases, with an estimate of the spin-offs linked to both technology transfers (RTO to industry) and to high-tech purchases (industry to RTO).",2022-03,2/23/23 13:55,2/23/23 13:55,,44-69,,1,13,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000605115200001,,,,,; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/8MSHFUZK/Taverdet-Popiolek - 2022 - Economic Footprint of a Large French Research and .pdf,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs13132-020-00709-2.pdf,Technology transfer; IMPACT; INNOVATION; POLICY; KNOWLEDGE; GROWTH; SPILLOVERS; RETURNS; Case study; Co-creation of knowledge; D; Economic footprint; Economic impact of research; Economic spin-offs of R&; Procurement of high technology; PROGRAMS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Francis O. Schmitt, known as the founding father of the NRP, was a famous biologist and an avid reader of cybernetics. Focusing on the intellectual and institutional context that Schmitt was situated in, this article unveils the way that the brain was conceptualized as a distinct object, requiring the launch of a new research community in the US. In doing so, this article moves beyond the dominant narratives on the triumph of molecularization of the brain at the beginning of neuroscience. Instead, it argues that what brought researchers together in the name of neuroscience was not just a molecule but an aspiration to develop biological theories of the brain/mind, which resonated with biologists in a postwar context and was materialized through support for basic research. The article highlights the tension over the computerization and molecularization of the brain, which shaped the interdisciplinary gathering of neuroscientists in the context of growing interest in basic research. Thereby, this article reveals the rise of theoretical concerns in brain science that reflect the distinct desires and concerns of biologists in the US at an intellectual and institutional level. By revisiting the launch of the NRP with a focus on Schmitt, the article sheds light on the historical contingencies in launching the new community as neuroscience in the US and their meaning for the locality and transiency of (inter)disciplinarity in brain science.",2023-02,2/23/23 13:55,2/23/23 13:55,,103-130,,1,36,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000853964000001,,,,,; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/R57B6I3X/Shin - 2023 - For or against the molecularization of brain scien.pdf,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/09526951221116260,neuroscience; interdisciplinarity; BASIC RESEARCH; INFORMATION; BIG SCIENCE; BIRTH; cybernetics; Francis O; MIND; molecularization; Schmitt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Collaborations between (permanent) instrument scientists and users are at the core of these organisations, yet knowledge about the nature of such collaborations and their development over time is surprisingly scarce. In particular, we know very little about the interrelation between the individual and organisational drivers of collaboration. Based on a qualitative study of scientists and their collaborations at Institut Laue-Langevin, a world leading neutron source, we identify four typical collaboration patterns, which reflect particular configurations of (dis)similarity between instrument scientists and users in terms of perceived expertise gap and co-development focus. Our findings suggest that the co-existence of multiple collaboration types within the same organisation plays an important role in the long-term success of LSRIs. In addition, we contend that dissimilarity can generate productive collaboration to the same extent as partner similarity; not only at the organisational level - co-existence of different types of collaborations across the LSRI, favouring the co-existence of a broad range of instrumentation - but also at the individual level - where instrument scientists benefit in terms of more productive collaborations over time despite the cost of learning involved.",2019-06,2/23/23 13:55,2/23/23 13:55,,1282-1296,,5,48,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000463687300015,,,,,; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/WPGCS779/D'Ippolito and Ruling - 2019 - Research collaboration in Large Scale Research Inf.pdf,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733319300198/pdfft?md5=b832d5bcfeebbbcfadddc5530d322817&pid=1-s2.0-S0048733319300198-main.pdf&isDTMRedir=Y,PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; ORGANIZATION; Research collaboration; PATTERNS; TEAMS; SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION; NETWORKS; BIG-SCIENCE; COAUTHORSHIP; Collaboration pattern; Large Scale Research Infrastructures (LSRIs); Partner (dis)similarity; UNIVERSITY-RESEARCH CENTERS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach Starting from the exploratory nature of this research, a single case study research strategy has been applied. The impact of basic research public procurement has been estimated using survey data on 168 INFN supplier companies. Supplier companies have been surveyed on six different categories of company outcomes, namely, sales volume, learning and innovation, relationship with the market, alliances and network and social impact. Findings Results of the analysis reported that the activity of INFN public procurement generates a positive impact on supplier companies on different dimensions, especially related to learning and innovative outcome and economic impact and market penetration outcome. Social implications Policy implications can be derived from the current study. In particular, to support the policymakers in the effort of assessing the impact of basic research public procurement, this study, first highlights the impact dimensions on supplier companies, and second, it provides empirical evidence of public procurement as a viable tool to foster companies' innovation.

Specifically, the aim of the paper is to identify the mechanisms and disentangle the channels driving this process. Our testing ground is the Italian Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN). We frame our study as a mixed-methods research project: three distinct but complementary methodologies are employed, which combine quantitative and qualitative evidence. Firstly, econometric and Bayesian Network analyses are performed, using the information collected through an online survey to suppliers as well as balance-sheet data extracted from online databases. Then, five case studies are investigated in depth, carrying out direct interviews with company staff. Our findings suggest that four types of benefits stem from suppliers' cooperation with INFN: learning, innovation, market penetration, and networking. These gains represent ""intermediate outputs"" which in turn impact on suppliers' socio-economic performance. We provide evidence that suppliers involved in innovative procurement usually experience the greatest benefits. This is mainly explained by the new technical competencies acquired, which are exploited to develop new products that support company business development and sales. In contrast, reputational gains, leading to the acquisition of new clients, are experienced also by companies involved in regular procurement.",,2/23/23 13:55,2/23/23 13:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000601216200001,,,,,; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/XS42MS4J/Castelnovo and Dal Molin - The learning mechanisms through public procurement.pdf,https://air.unimi.it/bitstream/2434/784125/2/CDM2020_rev_final.pdf,innovation; public procurement; basic research; FRAMEWORK; COLLABORATION; INDUSTRY; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; COST-BENEFIT-ANALYSIS; ACADEMIC RESEARCH; BIG-SCIENCE; LARGE HADRON COLLIDER; UNIVERSITY-RESEARCH; ECONOMIC-IMPACT; technological spillovers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known, however, about preferences of the latter except in the form of qualitative social attitudes survey. We suggest that understanding taxpayers' preferences in the form of their willingness to pay (a money metric) for fundamental science is feasible and informative. We have designed a contingent valuation (CV) experiment about public support of science as reflected in the preferences of Swiss taxpayers for particle physics research at CERN, the laboratory where the Higgs boson has been discovered in 2012. Differently from a previous study on the attitudes of French citizens, in this paper we propose a novel methodological framework by a dual repeated bidding mechanism where sub-samples of respondents are respectively given/not given the information on the implicit tax they already pay to support CERN in the first place. We find clear convergence of results between the groups and discuss why such a finding has policy and methodological implications for research on government funding of basic research.

Since 1982, we find a steady drop in the number of grant-eligible basic-science faculty [principal investigators (PIs)] younger than 46. This fall occurred over a 32-y period when inflation-corrected congressional funds for NIH almost tripled. During this time, the PI success ratio (fraction of basic-science PIs who are R01 grantees) dropped for younger PIs (below 46) and increased for older PIs (above 55). This age-related bias seems to have caused the steady drop in the number of young basic-science PIs and could reduce future US discoveries in fundamental biomedical science. The NIH recognized this bias in its 2008 early-stage investigator (ESI) policy to fund young PIs at higher rates. We show this policy is working and recommend that it be enhanced by using better data. Together with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA) program to reward senior PIs with research time in exchange for less funding, this may reverse a decades-long trend of more money going to older PIs.

This has been a boon to scientists from smaller communities, including the Canadian. However, policy-makers now increasingly look to specific economic, social, or political return on investments. The ""free access"" model is actively defended in the scientific community but is currently under pressure. In fact, the ""free access"" model has never been applied in all disciplines. This paper considers the origin and limit of the ""free use based on scientific quality"" approach to access to major facilities. The issue is particularly relevant for smaller scientific communities. In consequence, data from the experience of Canadian astronomers and physicists is reported to illustrate the trends. Access rules depend on the role of the three major partners, academia, government, and industry, and provide an important indicator of the structure of the triple helix partnership. We see an evolution from simpler prewar relations through the period dominated by academic science to the present complex of relationships that are still in evolution. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

This article examines the 1957-58 International Geophysical Year as a powerful fulcrum in the transfer of ideas about Earth's global environment from Western security establishments to conservationists worldwide. For eighteen months, tens of thousands of researchers across every continent pooled resources for data collection to create a scientific benchmark for future comparisons. Illuminating Earth as dynamic and interconnected, participants robustly conceptualized humanity's emergence as a geophysical force, capable of 'artificially' modifying the natural world.

By covering the costs of Open Access publishing, the idea is that 'no science should be locked behind paywalls.' However, not all environmental science receives funding from large institutions and much work, especially in developing nations, is undertaken on small grants from environmental non-governmental organisations. The European move is likely to push journals to abandon free-to-publish options in favour of costly Open Access, leaving such Small Science with fewer publication options and establishing a monopoly on peer-review for Big Science. While the goal of removing the publication paywall is a laudable one, the consequences of the proposed coalition may act contrary to the goal of making all science available to all people.

This project follows a 2x2 research design: two of the collaborations are big science while two are little science, two have completed data collection activities while two are ramping up data collection. This paper is centered on one of these collaborations, a project bringing together scientists to study subseafloor microbial life. This collaboration is little science, characterized by small teams, using small amounts of data, to address specific questions. Our case study employs participant observation in a laboratory, interviews (n = 49 to date) with scientists in the collaboration, and document analysis. We present a data work flow that is typical for many of the scientists working in the observed laboratory. In particular, we show that, although this workflow results in datasets apparently similar in form, nevertheless a large degree of heterogeneity exists across scientists in this laboratory in terms of the methods they employ to produce these datasets-even between scientists working on adjacent benches. To date, most studies of data in little science focus on heterogeneity in terms of the types of data produced: this paper adds another dimension of heterogeneity to existing knowledge about data in little science. This additional dimension makes more complex the task of management and curation of data for subsequent reuse. Furthermore, the nature of the factors that contribute to heterogeneity of methods suggest that this dimension of heterogeneity is a persistent and unavoidable feature of little science.",2015-05,2/23/23 13:55,2/23/23 13:55,,61-77,,1,16,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000409776400007,,,,,; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/23IR27J2/Darch et al. - 2015 - What lies beneath Knowledge infrastructures in t.pdf,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00799-015-0137-3.pdf,Big science; SCIENCE; ECOLOGY; Data deluge; Knowledge infrastructures; Little science; Multidisciplinary scholarship; SENSOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, most of the metrics for assessing the vitality of science or for making funding and policy decisions are based on productivity. Similarly, the increasing level of knowledge production by large science teams, whose results often enjoy greater visibility, does not necessarily mean that ""big science"" leads to cognitive expansion. Here we present a novel, big-data method to quantify the extents of cognitive domains of different bodies of scientific literature independently from publication volume, and apply it to 20 million articles published over 60-130 years in physics, astronomy, and biomedicine. The method is based on the lexical diversity of titles of fixed quotas of research articles. Owing to large size of quotas, the method overcomes the inherent stochasticity of article titles to achieve <1% precision. We show that the periods of cognitive growth do not necessarily coincide with the trends in publication volume. Furthermore, we show that the articles produced by larger teams cover significantly smaller cognitive territory than (the same quota of) articles from smaller teams. Our findings provide a new perspective on the role of small teams and individual researchers in expanding the cognitive boundaries of science. The proposed method of quantifying the extent of the cognitive territory can also be applied to study many other aspects of 'science of science.' (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to show that, we adopt a Schumpeterian growth model where the resources allocated to science are endogenously determined within the economy and science is organised according to the institution of ""Open Science"". This latter consists in a self-reinforcing code of conduct, which comprises an incentive scheme based on the priority rule, and on the presence of both real rewards and social rewards. Social rewards take two main forms according to the source concerned: one is the social reward deriving from major innovations; another consists in high reputation enjoyed by researchers who put a high level of effort into their job, and devote themselves to the advancement of science. This set of rules causes the emergence of two locally stable steady-states: a low equilibrium, where the economy is endowed with a small science sector; and a high equilibrium, where the economy has a large science sector with rapid knowledge advancement. The two equilibria can account for the huge differences currently existing between scientific sectors of more developed and less developed countries. Comparative static results further characterise the two equilibria, since monetary and social rewards have different effects according to the type of equilibrium that emerges. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Technology transfer is widely regarded as valuable in creating new products and companies, but the most effective modes of operation for this activity are rarely understood. This paper documents the catalyzing events, key obstacles and other influences at CERN during the 4-year journey of the TuoviWDM software project from its initiation in 1995 to the launching of a spin-off company in late 1998. The description proceeds in chronological order and focuses on the technological and organizational factors that have affected the innovation process. The TuoviWDM software is a WWW-based extended enterprise interface to product data management systems and to data vaults residing in proprietary information systems. A group of organizations uses this integrated whole to store and access information and to manage operational processes. The large projects and global user base at CERN provided the development team with an extremely flexible, occasionally surprisingly benign, and always challenging environment to develop the system. The opportunities to exploit the diversity hidden in the world's largest particle physics laboratory are immense. However, this case has again demonstrated that in a public sector organization the climate, the procedures, and the decision-makings bodies, which are related to creation of technology and to technology transfer, may be supportive, irrelevant or even counter-productive, The goal of technology transfer activity should be to fertilize the industries of the participating countries rather than to try to obtain additional finance for the research organization. Policy makers need to compare the weight of these two aspects when technology transfer policies are formulated for big science organizations. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To many in Latin America, scientific aid or cooperation from the North has often reproduced hierarchies that perpetuate dependency. Large astronomy observatories located in Chile - with a high price tag, cutting-edge technology, and seen to answer seemingly arcane research questions - seem ripe for reproducing precisely these kinds of hierarchical relationships. Using data from documents, interviews, and a site visit to Gemini South, one of several large telescopes in Chile, this paper takes a historical perspective to examine how resilient these hierarchical relationships are. Over forty years, astronomy in Chile grew thanks to new policies that fostered cooperation among universities and gave locals privileged access to the telescopes. But the community also grew in ways that reproduced dependency: foreign science benefits significantly, the Chilean state operates in top-down ways, and its support for science leaves it blind to the benefits high-tech telescopes deliver to Chile, which are not linked to export-led growth.

An Explorative Study of Contemporary Highly Cited Researchers,JOURNAL OF DATA AND INFORMATION SCIENCE,,2096-157X,10.2478/jdis-2021-0019,,"Purpose: The ranking lists of highly cited researchers receive much public attention. In common interpretations, highly cited researchers are perceived to have made extraordinary contributions to science. Thus, the metrics of highly cited researchers are often linked to notions of breakthroughs, scientific excellence, and lone geniuses. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, we analyze a sample of individuals who appear on Clarivate Analytics' Highly Cited Researchers list. The main purpose is to juxtapose the characteristics of their research performance against the claim that the list captures a small fraction of the researcher population that contributes disproportionately to extending the frontier and gaining-on behalf of society-knowledge and innovations that make the world healthier, richer, sustainable, and more secure. Findings: The study reveals that the highly cited articles of the selected individuals generally have a very large number of authors. Thus, these papers seldom represent individual contributions but rather are the result of large collective research efforts conducted in research consortia. This challenges the common perception of highly cited researchers as individual geniuses who can be singled out for their extraordinary contributions. Moreover, the study indicates that a few of the individuals have not even contributed to highly cited original research but rather to reviews or clinical guidelines. Finally, the large number of authors of the papers implies that the ranking list is very sensitive to the specific method used for allocating papers and citations to individuals. In the ""whole count"" methodology applied by Clarivate Analytics, each author gets full credit of the papers regardless of the number of additional co-authors. The study shows that the ranking list would look very different using an alternative fractionalised methodology. Research limitations: The study is based on a limited part of the total population of highly cited researchers. Practical implications: It is concluded that ""excellence"" understood as highly cited encompasses very different types of research and researchers of which many do not fit with dominant preconceptions. Originality/value: The study develops further knowledge on highly cited researchers, addressing questions such as who becomes highly cited and the type of research that benefits by defining excellence in terms of citation scores and specific counting methods.",2021-04,2/23/23 13:55,2/23/23 13:55,,41-66,,2,6,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000646175200003,,,,,; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/ZMPBFITH/Aksnes and Aagaard - 2021 - Lone Geniuses or One among Many An Explorative St.pdf,https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jdis-2021-0019,Big science; IMPACT; Citation; Research excellence; Nobel Prize; INDICATORS; Highly cited researchers; PROGRESS; SCIENTIFIC EXCELLENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this paper is to elaborate on the relevance of some of Weinberg's original arguments to priority setting today. We have singled out four issues for attention: The tension between scientific and institutional choice, the assumptions behind the triad of scientific, technological and social merit, the elusive 'externality from size' argument for funding promoted by Weinberg, and finally the problems involved in the idea of basic science as an 'overhead cost' for applied science, and applied science as an 'overhead' on a sectoral mission.

The findings indicate that NS and SSH researchers frequently cite LSBS as a source that is related to a specific topic and as evidence to support a claim. No significant differences were identified in the distribution of cited concepts included in LSBS, but significant differences were observed in the reasons for citing LSBS between NS and SSH citing articles. However, reverse trends were observed in the percentage of some cited concepts and citation functions between NS and SSH, which implies that subtle differences in citation behavior exist between NS and SSH researchers.

The paper proposes a double-blind communication and tendering procedure for establishing the means, partners and economic framework for the projects that finally commit to accomplish the task. This procedure sets a dedicated technological broker in to central position of the information exchange between the buyer and supplier. The presented procedure reduces any political interference, ensures more accurate cost estimates and helps the project to obtain better financial basis to kick-off. When in operation, the procedure can be used for determining the costs and most prominent technological trajectories for a proposed solution.

This way, the Wiener's conceptions and practices concerning interdisciplinarity are compared with their historical context, showing analogies and peculiarities. For Wiener, interdisciplinary research by very small groups whose members have a very broad interdisciplinary basis is an essential prerequisite for new fundamental ideas for invention and discoveries. On the contrary, in his opinion, mass attacks by large well financed interdisciplinary research groups with a big number of overspecialized member is useful only in a second phase in which invention and discoveries need to be implemented by designers and developers. Finally, through a conceptual matching between Wiener's ideas and the ones of Jose Ortega y Gasset, it appears how the Wienerian small interdisciplinary group would fit better with the Kuhnian revolutionary phase in science, while the big interdisciplinary group would fit better to the Kuhnian normal science.",2017-10,2/23/23 13:55,2/23/23 13:55,,173-180,,,229,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000413281300024,,,,,"; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/FWU94PUR/Montagnini - 2017 - Interdisciplinarity in Norbert Wiener, a mathemati.pdf",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301462217302090/pdfft?md5=85c2da0bc7ef1474763f572a09d7ba7c&pid=1-s2.0-S0301462217302090-main.pdf&isDTMRedir=Y,Big science; Interdisciplinarity; SCIENCE; Creativity in science; CYBERNETICS; Norbert Wiener; Rosenblueth's supper club; Royce's seminar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increasing array of scientific fields face a ""data deluge.'' However, in many fields data are scarce, with implications for their epistemic status and ability to command funding. Consequently, they often attempt to develop infrastructure for data production, management, curation, and circulation. A component of a knowledge infrastructure may serve one or more scientific domains. Further, a single domain may rely upon multiple infrastructures simultaneously. Studying how domains negotiate building and accessing scarce infrastructural resources that they share with other domains will shed light on how knowledge infrastructures shape science. Methods. We conducted an eighteen-month, qualitative study of scientists studying the deep subseafloor biosphere, focusing on the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations (C-DEBI) and the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) and its successor, the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP2). Our methods comprised ethnographic observation, including eight months embedded in a laboratory, interviews (n = 49), and document analysis. Results. Deep subseafloor biosphere research is an emergent domain. We identified two reasons for the domain's concern with data scarcity: limited ability to pursue their research objectives, and the epistemic status of their research. Domain researchers adopted complementary strategies to acquire more data. One was to establish C-DEBI as an infrastructure solely for their domain. The second was to use C-DEBI as a means to gain greater access to, and reconfigure, IODP/IODP2 to their advantage. IODP/IODP2 functions as infrastructure for multiple scientific domains, which creates competition for resources. C-DEBI is building its own data management infrastructure, both to acquire more data from IODP and to make better use of data, once acquired. Discussion. Two themes emerge. One is data scarcity, which can be understood only in relation to a domain's objectives. To justify support for public funding, domains must demonstrate their utility to questions of societal concern or existential questions about humanity. The deep subseafloor biosphere domain aspires to address these questions in a more statistically intensive manner than is afforded by the data to which it currently has access. The second theme is the politics of knowledge infrastructures. A single scientific domain may build infrastructure for itself and negotiate access to multi-domain infrastructure simultaneously. C-DEBI infrastructure was designed both as a response to scarce IODP/IODP2 resources, and to configure the data allocation processes of IODP/IODP2 in their favor.",2016-11,2/23/23 13:55,2/23/23 13:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000437460800002,,,,,; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/88NV7KMG/Darch and Borgman - 2016 - Ship space to database emerging infrastructures f.pdf,https://peerj.com/articles/cs-97.pdf,Big science; SCIENCE; Microbiology; INFORMATION; Big data; ECOLOGY; Knowledge infrastructures; Little science; Scientific data; ARGOS; BIG DATA; BIOLOGY; BIOMEDICINE; Cyberinfrastructure; Data infrastructure; ETHNOGRAPHY; KNOWLEDGE INFRASTRUCTURES; Little data; Long tail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Motivations for cooperation are examined, distinguishing between direct benefits to the research and indirect strategic, economic or political benefits. Barriers include the growing significance of competitiveness issues and a mismatch of institutions. It is concluded that formal arrangements are beginning to catch up with the very substantial extent of 'bottom-up' global cooperation.

The CoE schemes are in general modelled on the organisational and research practices in the natural and life sciences. Compared to 'Big science', the humanities have been characterised by more individual research, flat structures, and usually less integration and coordination of research activities. In this article we ask: How does the introduction of CoEs affect the organisation of research and research practices in the humanities? By comparing Norwegian CoEs in different fields of research and studying the specific challenges of the humanities, we find that CoEs increase collaboration between different fields and make disciplinary and organisational boundaries more permeable, but so far they do not substantially alter individual collaboration patterns in the humanities CoEs. They further seem to generate more tensions in their adjacent environments compared to CoEs in other fields.",8/2/20,2/23/23 13:55,2/23/23 13:55,,1746-1757,,8,45,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000470460500001,,,,,; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/MJZ9SQX5/Borlaug and Langfeldt - 2020 - One model fits all How centres of excellence affe.pdf,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03075079.2019.1615044?needAccess=true,Research policy; SOCIAL-SCIENCES; POLICY; TRENDS; NETWORKS; centres of excellence; humanities; organisation of research; research practices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Distributed invention power is organised and regulated through the pervasive securitisation of technoscience: surveillance and control of technoscientific fields as well as financialisation of its activities and research outputs. The securitisation of science reorders the traditional split between the public sphere, the private sector and the commons. The folding of each one of these spheres into the other underlies a constant, often antagonistic, oscillation between big science and open science.

Based on our analysis of articles published in AD and JASIS from 1950 to 1999, we find that there has been a slow but perhaps inevitable shift based first on the single nonfunded researcher and author to a much wider research and publishing participation among authors, regions, corporate authors, and countries. This suggests not only cross-fertilization of ideas, but also more complex research questions. A small trend toward greater external funding further reinforces this hypothesis.

In contrast to dominating bibliometric studies of research productivity, we focus on academic attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions as predictors of becoming research top performers across European systems. Our paper provides a (large-scale and cross-country) corroboration of the systematic inequality in knowledge production, for the first time argued for by Lotka (J Wash Acad Sci 16:317-323, 1929) and de Solla Price (Little science, big science.

Two linked dynamics deserving further study are the role of geographic proximity and the role of information and communication technologies in facilitating knowledge flow across international networks. Studies of intra- and inter-firm knowledge transfer, managerial work values and cultural norms all point to China as being a fascinating counterpoint for the way knowledge exchange might occur in Europe. So in this study of the ATLAS collaboration, a big science' global network of 3,500 physicists, we explore the perceptions of two subgroups: UK physicists working in Europe and Chinese scientists based in Beijing and HeFei.

Speculative over-expansion led to diminishing returns on investment, then a collapse in funding. We predict that medicine will follow the same trajectory. After prolonged over-funding of the 'basic-to-applied' model of clinical innovation, and a progressive shift towards Big Science organization, medical research has become increasingly inefficient and ineffective.

Using ""radio telescopes"" that looked nothing like traditional (optical) telescopes, radio astronomers were a very different breed from traditional (optical) astronomers. This pathbreaking of radio astronomy also made it much easier for later ""astronomies"" and their ""telescopes"" (X-ray, ultraviolet, infrared, gamma-ray) to become integrated into astronomy after the launch of the space age in the 1960s. This paper traces the history of radio telescopes from 1945 through about 1990, from the era of converted small-sized, military radar antennas to that of large interferometric arrays connected by complex electronics and computers; from the era of strip-chart recordings measured by rulers to powerful computers and display graphics; from the era of individuals and small groups building their own equipment to that of Big Science, large collaborations and national observatories.",2009-08,2/23/23 13:55,2/23/23 13:55,,107-124,,3-Jan,25,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000267896100009,,,,,"; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/QUXR85T4/Sullivan - 2009 - The history of radio telescopes, 1945-1990.pdf",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10686-009-9140-2.pdf,History; Radio astronomy; Radio telescopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Large telescopes are unique but not exceptional: big science has become part of ""normal science,"" both scientifically and institutionally. In retrospect, the discussions anaylized in this paper discussions concern the earliest phase of three major astronomical instruments: the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), and the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR).

The analysis of such structures reveals a stable core of scholars with a long experience in Atapuerca's fieldwork, which would control coauthorship-related information flows, and a tree-like periphery mostly populated by 'external' researchers. Interestingly, this scenario corresponds to the idea of a Equipo de Investigacin de Atapuerca, originally envisioned by Atapuerca's first director 30 years ago.

This paper presents the case of research undertaken in ATLAS, one of four big experiments in high-energy physics using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva and one of the most important big science experiments to date. By gathering and analysing several micro-cases of individual experiences of ATLAS members, we propose that the size and complexity of the experiment do indeed influence the personal relationships among scientists themselves and also their relationships with their organizations.

On the other hand, we notice that the collaboration network does not follow a scale-free or power-law model, contrary to what happens in other studied collaboration networks in physics and other areas.

Solar wind energy enters this cavity through a boundary - the magnetopause - separating Earth's field from the solar wind. This energy leads to many forms of ""space weather"", including the aurora, geomagnetic storms, and energization of the Van Allen radiation belts. Despite decades of research, we still do not understand the extent of dayside reconnection sites, nor do we have a quantifiable understanding of how much energy enters the magnetosphere during different solar wind conditions - necessary for space weather prediction. On the nightside, impulsive flows at various spatial and temporal scales occur frequently during storms and substorms, and couple to the ionosphere through still unresolved physical mechanisms. Because the magnetosphere is so large, it has been understood since the dawn of the space age that a full understanding of this complex region could only be achieved with a large fleet of in situ spacecraft. NASA has studied one such constellation, the so-called ""Magnetospheric Constellation"" (MagCon), since the 1990's [1], but it is deemed too expensive to implement using traditional approaches. The CubeSat/SmallSat revolution represents a fundamental disruption to traditional mission architectures, and in this paper I will discuss how, by leveraging innovation in spacecraft subystems, advanced manufacturing, and access to space, we can finally realize this long-term vision of exploration and discovery.

Australian attempts during the period 1935-1960 to build accelerators or to acquire them by other means are described. The difficultie's that Australian physicists faced in this connection and the strategies by which they sought to overcome them are considered.

In this paper I try to answer the following questions: why did Nishina start the construction of two cyclotron in the mid-1930s?; how did he secure the necessary financial support?; what were the original objectives of the machines, and how were they were actually used?; what difficulties did he meet and overcome in the construction and running of the cyclotrons?; how significant was the Berkeley connection in contributing to the construction and operation of the cyclotrons?; why did Nishina skip the construction of the medium size cyclotron (30-40 inches) and move directly from a small (26-inch) to a large one (60-inch)?; and how much did the cyclotron project influence the future path of Japanese physics?

The ngVLA is envisaged as an interferometric array with ten times greater sensitivity and spatial resolution than the current VLA and ALMA, operating in the frequency range of 1.2 -116 GHz. Replacing both the VLA and VLBA, the ngVLA will be an open-skies, transformative, multi-disciplinary scientific instrument opening a new window on the Universe through ultra-sensitive imaging of thermal line and continuum emission down to milliarcsecond-scale resolution, as well as unprecedented broad-band continuum polarimetric imaging of non-thermal processes. The ngVLA will be optimized for observations in the spectral region between the superb performance of ALMA at sub-mm wavelengths, and the future Phase I Square Kilometer Array (SKA-1) at decimeter and longer wavelengths, resulting in a transformational instrument for the entire scientific community. In 2019, the ngVLA project completed the public release of the ngVLA Reference Design [2][3] as the technical and cost basis of the ngVLA Astro2020 Decadal Survey proposal [4]. With a strong endorsement of the facility concept by the Decadal Survey [5] and continued support from the National Science Foundation, the project is preparing for a System Conceptual Design Review in the spring of 2022.

These are required for applications in big science, security and biochemistry. A custom device called SAPHIRA (320x256/24 mu m) has been designed specifically for LmAPDs. SAPHIRA has been deployed as a wavefront sensor for adaptive optic systems in nine major telescopes and notably five devices control the four 8.2 metre telescopes of the VLT interferometer. These demanding applications have driven frames rates up to 200 kframes/s and avalanche gains to x600 achieving read noise as low as 0.26 e-rms and enabling single photon counting. The detector is baselined for time-domain astronomy vital for exoplanet spectroscopy and understanding the physics of active stellar objects. The three 30 metre class telescopes currently under construction and the three candidate space telescopes, HabEx, Luvoir and EZE will depend on noise-free infrared detectors at very low dark current. Work at the University of Hawaii and European Southern Observatory has demonstrated dark currents in the 4-10 electrons/hour range and with avalanche gain offers the prospect of higher science return from these instruments. A 1kx1k/15um 3-side buttable array is currently in development to service extreme low background applications especially spectroscopy.

The data archive and built-in query engine use the versatile Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5), which precludes the need for external metadata tables and hence the setup and maintenance overhead those carry. The code produces simple outputs that can easily be translated to plots and tables, and the combination of these tools makes for a light system that can handle heavy data. This article acts as a contextual companion to the SAMI Survey Database source code repository, samiDB, which is freely available online and written entirely in Python. We also discuss the decisions related to the selection of tools and the creation of data visualisation modules.

These features have been reinforced during the 20, h century with the rise of ""Big Science"" which required from scientists to convince and to gain support from different stakeholders: policy-makers, industrialists, foundations and general public. Electrostatics played an important role both in the transformation of research scales in physics laboratories and in the presentation of science to the general public. In this paper, we analyze how these changes occurred in France in the 1930s. A turning point in this history was the construction of the Palais de la Decouverte (Palace of discovery) in Paris as a Universal Exhibition pavilion and the exhibition of a large electrostatic Van de Graaff machine in its main Hall. This event was the outcome of different histories. First, the development of ""atomic machines"" designed to provide megavolts to accelerate particles, thus inaugurating ""Big Science"" laboratories in the thirties, a development promoted in France by Frederic Joliot-Curie. Second, the movement around Jean Perrin leading to the organization and public funding of French scientific research, with the establishment of an Undersecretary of State for scientific research and the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).

The reason for this is in the advance of science itself, where new experiments with unprecedented levels of accuracy, precision and coverage (time and spatial) are realised. Astronomy is one of the fields of the physical sciences where a strong interaction between the scientists, the instrument and software developers is necessary to achieve the goals of any Big Science Project. The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be the largest ground-based very high-energy gamma-ray observatory of the next decades. To achieve the full potential of the CTA Observatory, the system must be put into place to enable users to operate the telescopes productively. The software will cover all stages of the CTA system, from the preparation of the observing proposals to the final data reduction, and must also fit into the overall system. Scientists, engineers, operators and others will use the system to operate the Observatory, hence they should be involved in the design process from the beginning. We have organised a workgroup and a workflow for the definition of the CTA Top Level Use Cases in the context of the Requirement Management activities of the CTA Observatory. Scientists, instrument and software developers are collaborating and sharing information to provide a common and general understanding of the Observatory from a functional point of view. Scientists that will use the CTA Observatory will provide mainly Science Driven Use Cases, whereas software engineers will subsequently provide more detailed Use Cases, comments and feedbacks. The main purposes are to define observing modes and strategies, and to provide a framework for the flow down of the Use Cases and requirements to check missing requirements and the already developed Use-Case models at CTA sub-system level. Use Cases will also provide the basis for the definition of the Acceptance Test Plan for the validation of the overall CTA system.

This happened in spite of the fact that a number of influential European countries were at one time or another competitors to host the facility. It is also a story about politics which attempts to illustrate how closely intertwined politics and science are, and how the interplay between those interests affects scientific progress. ESS became an arena for individual ambitions and political manoeuvring. The different stakeholders, in their striving to ensure that their own interests were realised, in various ways and with different degrees of success over the years, have influenced the key decisions that, during the already 30 year history of ESS, have driven the course that this project has taken. What emerges is that the interests of the stakeholders and the interests of the project itself are frequently not in harmony. This imposes challenges on the management of large research facilities as they have to not only navigate in the scientific landscape, which they often are more familiar with, but also in the political landscape. This story is therefore an attempt to shed light on the role of managers of large research facilities and the often delicate balancing act they have to perform when trying to comply with the different and often conflicting stakeholder interests. What is especially worthwhile examining, as we do in this paper, is the role that individuals, and the interaction between individuals, have played in the process.

With that, one is able to carry out tabletop spectroscopy with high resolution in space, time and frequency.

The first moon landing offers a vantage point to analyse this transition, as it started a debate about science and crystallised hostility towards scientific funding through taxpayers' money. The reactions of the Western European Left towards Apollo were varied and can be classified into three categories: Big Science Socialism, which celebrated the positive feedback loop between science, state power and socialism; Earth-First Critique, which balanced celebration with reminding of urgent problems on Earth; Radical Anti-Scientism, to which Apollo epitomised imperialistic capitalism and the hegemony of materialistic scientism over humanism. The article examines three figures who approved the Apollo programme for helping collectivism (Tony Benn, Emilio Sereni, Karl Steinbuch) and three figures who condemned it (Marcello Cini, Nigel Calder, Robert Jungk). Beyond these extremes, the article examines the fourth, more nuanced position of the British Labour Party, the German Social Democrats (SPD) and the Italian Communist Party (PCI), which had to reinvent science policies beyond exhausted technocratic dreams and inflexible renunciation of technological modernity.",,2/23/23 18:12,2/23/23 18:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000764917900001,,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07075332.2022.2046129,astroculture; British Labour Party; First moon landing; Italian Communist Party (PCI); Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LLMW8RCA,bookSection,2012,"Peebles, PJE",Seeing Cosmology Grow,"ANNUAL REVIEW OF ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS, VOL 50",0066-4146,,,,"The modest science of cosmology I encountered a half century ago has grown into big science. I comment on steps in this development I think I understand because I was there or, in some cases, wish I had been. Wonderful insights-or lucky guesses-and elegant deductions from measurements were accompanied by the usual mix of unlucky guesses and disregard of unwelcome evidence. I say ""usual"" because I suspect the course of development of any other natural science is similarly erratic. An example in cosmology is Einstein's homogeneous Universe, which was largely accepted as a working hypothesis when there was scant evidence and seriously challenged after we had a reasonable case for homogeneity. Similar mixes of insight and inattention led to the eventual identification of the 3K microwave background, the demonstration that large-scale structure grew by the gravitational instability of the expanding Universe, and the completion of a tight network of cosmological tests. A half century ago, we had little idea what would become of what we were doing in cosmology. We have a better picture now, but I expect there to be more surprises.",2012,2/23/23 18:12,2/23/23 18:12,,28-Jan,,,50,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000310447000002,,,,,,http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-astro-081811-125526,BLACK-BODY RADIATION; COLD DARK-MATTER; cosmic microwave background radiation; COSMIC-BACKGROUND-RADIATION; cosmological principle; cosmological tests; GALAXY CORRELATION-FUNCTION; general relativity; GRAVITATIONAL-INSTABILITY PICTURE; gravity physics; LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE; LUMINOUS RED GALAXIES; Mach's principle; MEAN MASS DENSITY; SHANE-WIRTANEN COUNTS; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS,,"Faber, SM; VanDishoeck, E",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These teclmologies have been applied to a wide range of scenarios, including the distributed air-conditioning. food, medicine, health and sport for people's daily life, and centralized air-conditioning, heat pump and cryogenics in commercial and industrial applications. In the near future, global warming. urbanization and pursuit of higher living standard will continue to push the demand of air-conditioning. Food preservation for the increasing global population and fresh food e-commerce require more cold storage. Space detection, low-temperature imaging and ciyogenic medical treatment will push the cryogenics forward. Except for these listed applications, there are also many other driven forces for the next-step development of airconditioning and refrigeration, which make its future progress complicated. A comprehensive summary of the current status is necessary for air-conditioning and refrigeration, which will also provide us the basis to analyze its future perspectives. Three typical air-conditioning and refrigeration teclmologies are introduced at first. These include the refrigeration/heat pump. temperature -humidity control and cryogenics. Vapor compression refrigeration, absorption refrigeration, adsorption refrigeration, ejector refrigeration, solid state refrigeration, refrigeration without thermodynamic cycles and heat pumps are introduced for the first topic. which focuses on the temperature manipulation in normal temperature range. Condensation dehumidification, solution dehumidification, solid desiccant dehumidification and evaporative cooling are introduced for the second topic. which focuses on the interaction of temperature and humidity of air. Gas liquefaction and cryocooler are introduced for the third topic, which focuses on the thermal energy removal under low temperature. Conventional and emerging applications of these teclmologies are introduced afterwards. The refrigeration and dehumidification could support a wide range of application including air-conditioning, data center cooling, solar cooling, electrical vehicle thermal management and food/drug preservation. The applications of heat pumps include the clean heating supply and industrial heat recovery. The ciyogenics could be applied for air liquefaction, liquefied natural gas, hydrogen storage. cryobiology/cryomedicine and big science project. Based on the previous analysis, future challenges on efficiency enhancement, eco-friendly refrigeration and application promotion are presented at last. The efficiency enhancement is driven by the numerous equipments of air-conditioning and refrigeration in use. which consume a large portion of total power consumption of mankind It could be achieved through the innovation on heat exchanger. thermodynamic cycle and intelligent control. The eco-friendly refrigeration is driven by the enviromnental protection policies. Low GWP and ODP refrigerants including HFOs and natural refrigerant will be effective solutions. Small -sized heat exchanger with less refrigerant charge is also important. The application promotion is driven by the fact that air-conditioning and refrigeration have already become the basic technology supporting the emerging teclmologies. Except for the traditional applications, the air-conditioning and refrigeration technologies are becoming fundamental technologies for many multidisciplinary fields, including the data center cooling, electrical vehicle thermal management, clean heating. industrial waste heat recovery, cryobiology/cryomedicine, and big science project.",2020,2/23/23 18:12,2/23/23 18:12,,2555-2570,,24,65,,,,,,,,,,Chinese,,,,WOS:000565891900005,,,,,; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/APJPVM4Y/Xu and Wang - 2020 - Air-conditioning and refrigeration Current status.pdf,https://engine.scichina.com/doi/pdf/E8C9D8A2907C40EE91D6A441DF49EB35,WATER; air-conditioning; cryogenics cold storage; DEHUMIDIFICATION; heat pump; refrigeration; WASTE HEAT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new form of activity, the project, emerged through the management of technical means, allocation of skills, and coordination of various players. Project management emerged as the synthesis of a set of social practices designed to subordinate as well as synchronize the initiatives of researchers, engineers, and technicians who had temporarily joined forces. This article presents the genesis and deployment of the Franco-Soviet space program ARCAD 3 whose purpose was to study the magnetosphere with a satellite. This study is situated at the junction of three historiographical dimensions: scientific writings, links between action and graphic forms, and Big Science. The diagrams, organization charts and schedules produced by the French space agency throughout the entire project form the documentary substrata of this analysis. These graphic management tools define the role of each player, designate fields of competence, and specify the temporality of actions. A self-monitoring system as well as surveillance instrument, diagrams, organization charts and schedules are linked to form a certain vision of authority along the lines of the ""neoliberal governmentality"" defined by Michel Foucault. By defining in advance and in writing all the possible (or impossible) relationships, the chronological order of activities as well as the actions to be performed, graphic project management tools contribute to the transfer of coercive panoptic mechanisms towards a minimal organization of relationships between individuals.",2011-12,2/23/23 18:12,2/23/23 18:12,,545-586,,4,24,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000297945500004,,,,,; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/Q4ZLWHS8/Lamy - 2011 - What Management Does to Space Projects The Franco.pdf,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/A77E8B14DE0CB912039596848F33BDCD/S0269889711000226a.pdf/div-class-title-what-management-does-to-space-projects-the-franco-soviet-project-arcad-3-in-the-late-1970s-div.pdf,SYSTEM; FRENCH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This conjecture initially seemed impossible to verify since the new particle, which became known as the neutrino, was uncharged, had zero or small mass, and interacted only insignificantly with other matter. In 1951 Frederick Reines and Clyde L. Cowan, Jr., of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory undertook the difficult task of detecting the free neutrino by observing its inverse beta-decay interaction with matter. They succeeded in 1956. The neutrino was accepted rapidly as a fundamental particle despite discrepancies in reported details of the experiments and despite the absence of independent verification of the result, This paper describes the experiments, examines the nature of the discrepancies, and discusses the circumstances of the acceptance of the neutrino's detection by the physics community.",2001-09,2/23/23 18:12,2/23/23 18:12,,314-334,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000173709400004,,,,,; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/A9AFS6FP/Arns - 2001 - Detecting the neutrino.pdf,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FPL00000535.pdf,particle physics; BIG SCIENCE; nuclear physics; beta decay; Clyde L.

It has a long history, dating back to the beginning of JET in 1980. It utilises both commercially available hardware along with many in-house modules. The software has grown up and evolved largely independently of other developments in big science. Similarly, the data acquisition system on MAST has a long history of evolution from previous facilities at Culham (COMPASS). It utilises commercially available and in-house hardware (some shared with JET CODAS) and software that has developed largely independently of JET and other external developments. More recently, we have begun to adopt some ITER CODAC relevant technologies on both JET and MAST, in part, to also introduce some standardisation between the two facilities. This started with a pilot project to create a cubicle and environment monitoring system using commercial hardware and EPICS monitoring and HMI. We have since gone on to implement several camera and spectrometer filter controllers, several types of turbo molecular pump controller, and various radiation protection monitors in EPICS on JET. We are also implementing a central information display system for MAST that links the OPC interface on the machine control through to several display screens showing the machine state using EPICS. We have several MARTe based real time applications on JET and are now developing an application to provide real time processing of high -resolution Thomson scattering data using MARTe V2 (an ITER/F4E initiative to improve the robustness of this realtime framework). We are also considering upgrading the existing MARTe applications to this version. On JET we have also started to use another ITER CODAC technology - SDN to supplement the ATM based real time control network on JET. Initially, as a proof of principle, a real time plasma profile display was implemented. This system is now being extended to include several real time data sources which will feed their data back into the ATM network and on to the real time controllers. Looking forward, we anticipate extending the JET real time network with a purely ITER CODAC/SDN connected real time control system and provide a richer ITER CODAC interface to the JET CODAS to accommodate the possibility of ITER diagnostics testing and provide a real stress test for ITER archiving technologies.",2020-12,2/23/23 18:12,2/23/23 18:12,,,,,161,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000597322800003,,,,,; /Users/de51/Zotero/storage/I4AF4Y46/Waterhouse et al. - 2020 - Introduction of ITER CODAC relevant technologies o.pdf,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920379620304063/pdfft?md5=c751289f14ffa9b3602cfae34118cbdd&pid=1-s2.0-S0920379620304063-main.pdf&isDTMRedir=Y,EPICS; ITER CODAC; MARTe; SDN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
